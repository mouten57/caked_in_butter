      `Who doesn’t love a good donut? Whether you’re loyal to Shipley’s, Krispy Kreme, or Dunkin Donuts these baked strawberry donuts are sure to please! It may seem silly but donuts have always reminded me of my childhood. I grew up on the East Coast in North Carolina where Krispy Kreme is king - the ‘HOT’ sign was too tantalizing to ignore. 
      I have fond memories of Saturday morning drives with Dad to pick up donuts for the family before everyone was awake. What’s a Saturday morning without a glazed donut?`,

      `These strawberry donuts were inspired by one of my sweet friends who is in her first trimester- she said she had a dream where she asked me to find a recipe for strawberry donuts with sprinkles. So here it is!`,

      `For this recipe start with the best donut pan; I used the Nordic Ware pan which I loved but any donut pan will do. Keep in mind these donuts are baked, not fried, so they are going to have a different consistency- a bit more cakey but equally as delicious!`,

      `My hips don’t need a deep fryer in my house so baked donuts it is.`,

      `I used fresh strawberries here but next time I would use freeze dried or even high quality strawberry jam in its place. The fresh strawberries are high in water and although we want moist donuts we don’t want soggy ones. Using fresh fruit with high water content is always risky so don’t be afraid to experiment with different flavoring methods.`,

      `Douse these beauties in the icing and top with all the sprinkles!
These donuts are too delicious to not eat instantly but they will keep for 2-3 days in an air tight container.`,

      `Let’s get cookin!`

  //RECIPE #2 -> BISCOTTI

      `Valentine’s Day - the day you show your love to those around you. You shower them with diamonds, flowers, champagne and chocolate.. which is why today we’re making the most delicious dark chocolate & cherry biscotti to add to your romantic V-day breakfast. 
      
      I’ve never been a huge fan of Valentine’s Day. I try to show my love to my husband and daughter every day of the year but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy a holiday that gives me permission to eat all things chocolate. As if I even needed an excuse. My sweet tooth is hard to get under control. As far as sweets go there are few things I love more than chocolate... but chocolate... on a cookie... filled with cherries... count. Me. In.`,

      `If you don’t like chocolate, I’m not sure we were really ever friends...`,

      `For those of you who haven’t seen this crunchy cookie being sold at Starbuck’s counters all over the country, biscotti is an Italian cookie that is traditionally dry, crunchy and twice-baked. I was scared of making it- it seemed likes lot of work. But once I did it it wasn’t hard at all! The process can seem intimidating but let’s break it down. `,

      `Steps of Biscotti:
1) Mix dough 2) Split it in half 3) Flatten into slabs 4) Bake 5) Slice 6) Bake again`,
      `An important aspect to this recipe is cutting in the butter! If you don’t have a pastry cutter you can also use two forks. Cutting in the butter means you’re adding it in it cold and literally cutting it into the dough. The dough will be crumbly at first but that’s ok- you want that butter to stay cold until it gets into the oven. This creates pockets of crumbly flakes. This is also how biscuits and pie crusts are made! Fun fact: cutting in the butter shortens the strands of gluten one liquid is added to the flower- this is what creates a crumbly cookie! As I like to say when I try to sound smart... Science.`,
      `Anyway, this dough tends to be very sticky because of the wet ingredients. If you find that it is too sticky to handle, you can add a bit more flour but be careful not to add too much because if the dough gets too dry the slabs will fall when you slice them before their second bake. `,
      `Second bake! `,
      `The first bake is 25-30 minutes, a 10 minute rest (so the slabs can cool just a little bit before you slice) and then another 8-10 minutes on each side. Sooo thats about 40-50 minutes of cook-time for this little cookie. I know it sounds like a long time because you just want to devour them but I promise they need the second bake! The butter and oil will help keep them crunchy and crumbly without tasting like cardboard. Finishing the slabs off with an egg-wash will make them nice and shiny! I highly recommend.`,
      `I love love love this recipe because it takes basically no time to put together... you don’t have to drag out the mixer and you don’t have to chill the dough. Do you need any more convincing to make these? If so, I don’t think I can help you.`,
      `Ok. Enough talk. Lets bake!`

    ingredients: {
      Biscotti: [

        `Preheat oven to 350. Line your baking sheet with parchment paper.I also use a piece for my work surface for easy clean up.`,
        `Whisk flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt together until combined.Using either a pastry cutter or 2 forks cut in the butter.The dough will be crumbly.Stir in the dried cherries.In a medium bowl whisk the eggs, oil and extract.Pour the wet ingredients into the flour/ butter mixture and is until just combined.Overworking causes tough dough!`,
        `Turn the dough onto your lightly floured work surface.Knead very lightly until the dough is soft.If it’s too sticky to handle add one tablespoon of flour at a time- be careful to not add too much.Divide the dough and place each slab on the baking sheet.Form them into rectangles about 1/2 inch thick. Brush with egg wash.`,
        `Bake for 25 - 30 minutes(depending on your oven), or until the top of the biscotti is browned.Remove from oven.Let the biscotti rest for 10 minutes but do not turn off the oven.Slice the slabs into 1 inch sections and turn on their sides on the baking sheet.Bake for 8 - 10 minutes on each side.They may still be soft when they come out but they will harden as they cool on the rack.`,
        `Melt the baking chocolate in the microwave in 30 second bursts.Don’t burn it! Dip the biscotti into the chocolate and let cool on the rack or in the freezer.Sprinkle with additional dried cherries if you wish!`

      `If they’ll last that long... the biscotti will stay fresh for 1-2 weeks in a sealed container.`,
      `You can freeze the dough if you plan to make ahead. Thaw overnight.`

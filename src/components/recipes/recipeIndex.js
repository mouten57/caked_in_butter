      `Who doesn’t love a good donut? Whether you’re loyal to Shipley’s, Krispy Kreme, or Dunkin Donuts these baked strawberry donuts are sure to please! It may seem silly but donuts have always reminded me of my childhood. I grew up on the East Coast in North Carolina where Krispy Kreme is king - the ‘HOT’ sign was too tantalizing to ignore. 
      I have fond memories of Saturday morning drives with Dad to pick up donuts for the family before everyone was awake. What’s a Saturday morning without a glazed donut?`,

      `These strawberry donuts were inspired by one of my sweet friends who is in her first trimester- she said she had a dream where she asked me to find a recipe for strawberry donuts with sprinkles. So here it is!`,

      `For this recipe start with the best donut pan; I used the Nordic Ware pan which I loved but any donut pan will do. Keep in mind these donuts are baked, not fried, so they are going to have a different consistency- a bit more cakey but equally as delicious!`,

      `My hips don’t need a deep fryer in my house so baked donuts it is.`,

      `I used fresh strawberries here but next time I would use freeze dried or even high quality strawberry jam in its place. The fresh strawberries are high in water and although we want moist donuts we don’t want soggy ones. Using fresh fruit with high water content is always risky so don’t be afraid to experiment with different flavoring methods.`,

      `Douse these beauties in the icing and top with all the sprinkles!
These donuts are too delicious to not eat instantly but they will keep for 2-3 days in an air tight container.`,

      `Let’s get cookin!`

    closing: `Enjoy for breakfast with coffee or for lunch.. or dinner. Because we’re adults and we can eat donuts whenever we want.
